Spent a lifetime, finally found someone
Gave him all that I had
In love, 'til the dream was gone
I was losing myself
Out in the darkness, alone
But the night made me strong, and I learned to let go
Time mends the heart, you turn the page, somehow
There's no looking back, the hurtin's behind you now
Starting over again, on a second time around
Coming back to win
Starting over again, take the first step
Let it begin, starting over
Memories haunt you, feelings you won't forget
Learn to live a lesson in love, walk away without regret
Never deny, the fear that your heart defends
Find your way out, just when you've reached the end
Starting over again, no one's gonna count you out
When the heart is on
Starting over again, gotta come back
And turn it around, starting over
Take another look inside
Where you always had the fight
Never dreamed of givin' up
Never, no lookin' back
Starting over again, come a second time around
Coming back to win
Starting over again, take the first step
Let it begin, starting over
Starting over again, no one's gonna count you out
When the heart is on
Starting over again, gotta come back
And turn it around, starting over
Starting over again, no one's gonna count you out.
When the heart is on
Starting over, gotta come back
And turn it around, starting over
